      Deployment. Ops. Databases. Containers. Configuration management.
      Service discovery. Forget about all of them.

    <p>
      Flynn is all you need to know.
    </p>

    <p>
      Flynn is a simple, turnkey solution to cloud, containers, ops, whatever
      you want to call it. Flynn manages all the technology you need under the
      surface. So you get all the benefits with none of the work or complexity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Get back to writing your app and running your business.
    </p>

    <p>
      And Flynn gets better everyday. We track the infrastructure space closely
      and regularly integrate new components and features, so you get the best
      technology without having to figure out how everything fits together.
    </p>

    <p>
      And like all good things, it's completely free.

    <p>
      Users love your product and you're growing like crazy.  Your engineering
      team is already stretched thin keeping up with growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      You're using more cloud instances, apps, containers, languages,
      frameworks, and databases.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your ops team (if you have one) is already under water trying to keep up.
    </p>

    <p>
      Flynn helps you breeze through those challenges.
    </p>

    <p>
      Developers can deploy with a single command straight from git. Operators
      manage a single platform instead of doing custom work before each app can
      be deployed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Databases manage themselves. Service discovery, scheduling, containers,
      routing, and cluster management are all taken care of in the background.

      New languages, frameworks, version control systems, databases,

    <p>
      You need containers, microservices, polyglot everything, and cost savings
      yesterday.
    </p>

    <p>
      Developers need the best tools for the job in a changing world. Operators
      and IT teams need a platform they can manage instead of building
      everything from scratch, one piece at a time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Flynn has you covered. All the shiny new best practices in a single
      turnkey solution.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's free and open source so you can have tomorrow's technology today
      without any lock-in.
